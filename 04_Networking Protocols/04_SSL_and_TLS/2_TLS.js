/**
 * @description
 *!  TLS (Transport Layer Security)
 *   TLS is the successor to SSL, developed as a more secure, efficient encryption protocol. TLS
 *   ensures the privacy and integrity of data being transferred over a network.
 * 
 *?  Key Features of TLS include:
 **   - Encryption: Data is encrypted, meaning it can only be read by the intended recipient.
 **   - Authentication: TLS confirms that both parties involved in communication are who they claim to be, ensuring trust between the client and the server.
 **   - Data Integrity: TLS ensures that data cannot be altered or corrupted during transfer.
 *
 *?  How TLS Improves on SSL:
 **   - Stronger encryption algorithms: TLS uses more advanced algorithms, making it harder to decrypt intercepted communications.
 **   - Security patches: TLS addresses vulnerabilities found in SSL, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.
 **   - Efficiency: TLS provides faster performance, especially with the latest versions (e.g., TLS 1.3).
 *
 *   TLS is widely used in modern web applications and systems. For example, whenever you connect
 *   to a bankâ€™s website or a secure e-commerce platform, you're likely using a TLS-encrypted connection.
