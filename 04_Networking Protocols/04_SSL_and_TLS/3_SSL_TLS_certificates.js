 *!  SSL/TLS Certificates
 *   An SSL/TLS certificate is a digital credential that ensures secure communication between a
 *   website and its visitors. It verifies the website’s identity and encrypts data exchanged between the
 *   client (browser) and the server.
 * 
 *?  How SSL/TLS Certificates Work
 **   - Authentication: Confirms that the website is genuine and not an imposter.
 **   - Encryption: Protects data by converting it into a secure format that only the intended recipient can read.
 **   - Data Integrity: Ensures that the data remains unchanged during transmission.
 *
 *?  Key Information in an SSL/TLS Certificate
 **   - Domain Name: The website’s address.
 **   - Certificate Authority (CA): The organization that issued the certificate.
 **   - Public Key: Used for encrypting data.
 **   - Validity Period: The certificate’s expiration dates.
 **   - Digital Signature: Proof that the certificate is authentic.
