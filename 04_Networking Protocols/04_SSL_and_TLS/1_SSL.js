 *!  SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) 
 *   SSL is the original encryption protocol developed in the mid-1990s to secure communication over
 *   a network, particularly between web browsers and servers.
 **  Its primary function is to:
 *    ensure that data transferred over the internet remains encrypted and private.
 * 
 *   When a user connects to a website secured with SSL, a process called the "SSL handshake" occurs.
 *?  This handshake is responsible for:
 **   - Authentication: Verifying the identity of the website (typically through an SSL certificate).
 **   - Encryption: Establishing a secure, encrypted link between the user and the website.
 **   - Data Integrity: Ensuring that data transmitted over the connection isnâ€™t tampered with.
 *
 *   SSL secures sensitive data such as credit card numbers, login credentials, and personal
 *   information by encrypting it before transmission. While SSL was groundbreaking, it has been
 *   found to have several vulnerabilities (e.g., POODLE attack), leading to its deprecation. Modern
 *   security standards no longer support SSL, and it has been replaced by TLS.
