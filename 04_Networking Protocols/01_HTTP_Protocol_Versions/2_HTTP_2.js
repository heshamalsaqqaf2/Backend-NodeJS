/** 
 * @description
 *!  Http/2 Version
 *    Introduced to overcome the limitations of HTTP/1.1 in response to significant changes in web
 *    technology and user behavior. As the internet evolved, with users shifting to mobile devices and
 *    traditional connections becoming faster, web pages grew more complex. This complexity led to a
 *    mismatch between the speed at which content is delivered and connection speeds. HTTP/2
 *    addresses these challenges with key improvements designed to enhance performance and
 *    efficiency in web communication. HTTP/2 significantly improves upon HTTP/1.1 by introducing
 * 
 *?  several key features:
 **    - Multiplexing
 **    - Header Compression
 **    - Sever Push
 **    - Stream Prioritization
 **    - Binary Framing
 *
 *   While HTTP/2 offers significant improvements, it still relies on TCP as its underlying protocol.
 *   This allows for easier adoption but can present challenges in high-latency or lossy network environments.
