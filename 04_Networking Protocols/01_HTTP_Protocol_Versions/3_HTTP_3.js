 * @description
 *!  Http/3 Version
 *    Introduced in 2021, HTTP/3 further enhances performance by utilizing the QUIC protocol over
 *    UDP. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a transport layer protocol developed by Google
 *    as an improvement over TCP.
 * 
 *?  Here are some key points about QUIC:
 **    - It operates over UDP, which allows for faster connection establishment and reduced latency compared to TCP.
 **    - QUIC includes built-in encryption, enhancing security without the need for additional protocols.
 **    - It's designed to reduce connection setup time, which is particularly beneficial for applications requiring quick data transmission.
 **    - QUIC is especially advantageous for applications like live streaming and real-time communication, where speed and reliability are crucial.
 **    - One of QUIC's strengths is its ability to handle packet loss and network changes more efficiently than its predecessors, improving overall reliability and performance.
 *
 *   By utilizing QUIC, HTTP/3 achieves significant improvements in speed and its ability to handle
 *   packet loss and network changes more gracefully compared to its predecessors, making it
 *   particularly well-suited for modern web applications and services that require fast, secure, and robust data transmission.
