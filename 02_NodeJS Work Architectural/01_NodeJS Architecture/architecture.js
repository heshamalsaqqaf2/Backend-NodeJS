 *?   Overview of NodeJS Architecture
 *      NodeJS is a powerful and efficient JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
 *      It's designed to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser,
 *      allowing developers to create server-side applications with JavaScript.
 *      But how does NodeJS actually work under the hood?.
 * 
 *?   Core components
 *      At its core, NodeJS operates on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
 *      This architecture is what makes NodeJS lightweight and efficient,
 *      particularly suited for data-intensive real-time applications
 *      that run across distributed devices.Let's break this down:
 **        1- Event loop
 **        2- Libuv
 **        3- Built-in modules
