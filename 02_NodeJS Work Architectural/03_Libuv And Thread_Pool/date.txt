When JavaScript's single main thread encounters an asynchronous task, it delegates this task to libuv.
Libuv then handles the task using either native async mechanisms or the thread pool.
The default thread pool has 4 threads, meaning it can handle up to 4 asynchronous operations concurrently.
If a fifth operation is initiated, it will have to wait for one of the existing threads to become available.
