/** 
 * @What_Is_NPM
 *  NPM is the world’s largest software library containing code packages written by many different
 *  developers. With the help of NPM we get access to lots of code that we can use in our
 *  application. This is very beneficial as we don’t have to write code that is available out there that
 *  someone else has written. NPM is also a package manager. In order for us to use this library we
 *  need a way to manage the packages that we use, for example we can use NPM to import or
 *  update a package, manage package versions or publish packages to NPM library. It comes with a
 *  CLI (Command line interface) that let us manage our project packages. NPM comes installed with
 *  NodeJS as it is the default package manager for node. To make sure NPM is installed in the
 *  terminal run the command npm-v , If NPM is installed properly you will see the version printed to the terminal.
