 *?   How Does NodeJS Work? An Architectural Overview
 *      NodeJS architecture is based on a single-threaded,
 *      event-driven model designed for handling multiple concurrent connections efficiently.
 *      Learn about the event loop, libuv, thread pool, modules, and packages that give NodeJS
 *      its non-blocking, asynchronous nature that makes it ideal for building scalable and 
 *      high-performance applications.
