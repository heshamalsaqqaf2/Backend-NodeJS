/** 
 * @NodeJS_Modules_Explained
 *  A module in NodeJS is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality.
 *  It can be either custom-written or sourced from third-party developers,
 *  and then imported into other JavaScript files for use.
 *  Modules serve several important purposes:
 **    - Code Organization:
 *        They help structure large applications into manageable, logical units.
 **    - Reusability: 
 *        Modules allow developers to reuse code across different parts
 *        of an application or even in different projects.
 **    - Maintainability:
 *        By separating concerns, modules make code easier to update and maintain.
 **    - Scope Management:
 *        Each module has its own scope, preventing variable conflicts between
 *        different parts of an application.
 * 
 *  The module system is a fundamental concept in NodeJS.
 *  Every file is treated as a separate module, which means that variables
 *  and functions defined in one file are not accessible in another file unless\
 *  explicitly exported and imported. This modular approach promotes
 *  clean, efficient, and scalable code architecture.
