/** 
 * @Types_Modules_NodeJS
 *  NodeJS supports various types of modules, each serving a specific
 *  purpose in application development:
 **    1- Local modules:
 *         - Custom modules created by developers for their specific application.
 *         - Encapsulate reusable code and functionality unique to the project.
 *         - Local modules promote code organization and maintainability.
 **    2- Built-in modules:
 *         - Core modules that come pre-installed with NodeJS.
 *         - Examples include 'fs' for file system operations,
 *              'http' for creating web servers, and 'path' for handling file paths.
 *         - Built-in modules provide essential functionality without requiring additional installations.
 **    3- Third-party modules
 *         - These are modules created by the NodeJS community and available through
 *              npm (Node Package Manager).We will learn about npm and third-party
 *              modules in the next lesson.
 *         - They extend NodeJS capabilities and offer pre-built solutions
 *              for common development tasks.
 *         - Popular examples include ExpressJS for web application frameworks
 *              and Lodash for utility functions.
 * 
 *  Understanding these module types allows us to leverage a wide range of functionalities,
 *  from our own custom-built solutions to community-driven packages,
 *  enhancing productivity and code reusability in NodeJS applications.
